    <h1>Git Introduction</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system essential for modern web development, enabling collaboration and efficient code management. With Git, developers can track changes to their projects, create branches for parallel development, and seamlessly merge modifications. Its decentralized structure empowers teams to work independently on diverse features, while preserving a unified codebase. Git's ability to handle large-scale projects and its robust branching and merging capabilities make it an indispensable tool for web development, fostering collaboration, versioning, and ensuring the integrity of code throughout the development lifecycle. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, mastering Git is fundamental for streamlined and effective web development.</p>
